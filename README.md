# Kloneshop

This is currently just an empty repository where I am just gathering the requirements. The aim of this project is to build a functional clone of Photoshop 7.

# Plan
Once I gather some functionalities that PS 7, does, the coding will be done in QT, C++. The target platform will be Linux, but it should be trivial to compile for Win32.
